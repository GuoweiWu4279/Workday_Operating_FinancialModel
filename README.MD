# Workday Operating Model (2020–2024)

This project presents a driver-based operating model for Workday, Inc., built in Excel using historical financial statements and simplified forward assumptions.

The model focuses on understanding Workday’s revenue recognition, cost structure, deferred revenue dynamics, and operating cash flow, rather than precise treasury forecasting or valuation.

---

## 📌 Model Objective

- Analyze the quality of revenue growth and operating leverage
- Understand how deferred revenue impacts reported revenue and cash flow
- Evaluate whether operating cash flow is driven by profitability or accounting effects
- Assess equity sustainability under a no-new-financing assumption

---

## Key Takeaways

- Revenue grows steadily (~15% CAGR), but operating losses persist through 2024
- Cost structure remains heavily weighted toward Sales & Marketing and R&D
- Deferred revenue continues to grow, but ~97% is recognized within 12 months, indicating predominantly annual contracts
- Positive operating cash flow is largely driven by non-cash adjustments (SBC, deferred revenue)
- Under a no-financing assumption, retained earnings continue to decline, highlighting reliance on future margin improvement or capital raises
